        <p>AlaskaBenefits.org is a new service being prototyped by <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a> to make it possible for Alaskans to apply for benefits online. Normally, you must bring or mail your printed out application into the <a href="http://dhss.alaska.gov/dpa/Pages/contacts.aspx" target="_blank">closest Public Assistance Office</a>. This website is a prototype of a digital application process.</p>

        <p>Because this service is new, there is a risk of taking longer than if you brought the printed out application to an office. We believe it will end up being much faster though. If there are any problems with your application, we'll gladly compensate you for your troubles with $20 in Amazon gift cards.</p>

        <p>After you submit your application, we'll be in touch by text message or email to follow up on the status of your case. We want to learn how to best make a digital process, to help everyone who is applying for benefits.</p>
